This flutter Android App mainly implements three features:
1. The app's homepage is Gif Page where there is a random Gif shown everytime the page is navigated from and to and there is also a button with which the user can manually change the gif and fetch another Gif. I have used Giphy api for this.
2. The app's second page is a Book List page in which a list of 10 random book is shown whenever it's navigated to. The data is fetcged from fakerapi.it
3. The app's third page shows the live weather of IIT Kanour. It fetches data from a OpenWeather API and displays Current Temperature, Humidity and other stuff.
